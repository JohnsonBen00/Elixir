in it. concat() prints the concatenation of two seperate strings. length() prints the length of 'hello' and 
equalabc(str) returns true of false if the parameter is equal to 'abc'.

To run program follow steps 1-3 starting at line 6:

ListType.ex:
This file contains a module "ListType" which contains five methods: listHead(), listTail(), concatLists(), subLists(),
lenList(). These five methods demonstrate how a list can be used in Elixir. listHead() returns the head of list 
"[0, "hello", 4]". listTail() returns the tail of that same list. concatLists() concats [1, 2, 3] with [4, 5, 1] 
using ++. subLists() subtracts elements from the first list that are in the second list using --, using the same list 
as concatLists(). lenList() returns the length of list [0, "hello", 4].

replaceTuple() replaces the element at index 1 with "world".
sizeTuple() returns the size of the tuple.

midterms, final, project and participation. Name and class are strings representing the name of a student and the
class. Assignments and midterms are arrays of integers and or floats. The last three parameters: final, project and
participation are integers or floats, all these represent percentages of what was obtained on said assignment. This
method will calculate the overall grade and print if the student passed or failed the class with the grade and percentage
printed. This method demonstrates the use of all the data types discussed in the data types section.

mildlyuseful.ex:
This file contains a module "MILDUSE" which contains three methods: "multiply(a, b)", "addMultiply(a, b)", "sub(a, b)". 
multiply takes in two integers , a and b, and simply multiplies them. addMultiply(a, b), multiplies a and b ny calling
previous multiply function, then add it to the addtion of a and b like so "(a*b)+(a+b)". sub also takes in two integers
a and b, squares a and subtracts that from b squared like so "(a*a)-(b*b)". This demonstrates how to use subprograms in 
elixir by calling other methods in its module. 

To run program follow steps 1-3 starting at line 6:
4) Enter c("mildlyuseful.ex")
5) Enter mildlyuseful. - followed by one of three methods described above with two integer parameters. 
6) Done

MasterMind.ex:
This file is a Mastermind game. In this game, the computer chooses 4 out of the 6 colors. The player's job is then to guess the colors
that the computer has chosen in the proper order. After each guess by the player, if the player's guess is not correct, the computer
will give one number as feedback. The number represents how many where the right color and right position.

The game ends when the color string is correct -- and the player wins -- or they give 10 incorrect guesses -- and lose.

To run program follow steps 1-3 starting at line 6:
4) Enter c("MasterMind.ex")
5) Enter MasterMind.start()
