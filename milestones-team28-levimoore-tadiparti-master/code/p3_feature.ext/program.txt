Our program will implement a Mastermind game. In this game, the computer chooses 4 pegs each with one of 6 colors. The player's job is then to guess the colors that the computer has chosen in the proper order. After each guess by the player, if the player's guess is not correct, the computer will give a number as feedback. The number is how many pegs are the proper color and in the proper position.

The game ends when the color string is correct -- and the player wins -- or they give 10 incorrect guesses -- and they lose.

Generates a random computer guess of four colors out of:
	Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple
Reads a guess from the user as a string of colors
Scores the guess, and reports the feedback back to the user
Allows the user to continue to guess until they get it correct or reach 10 turns and they lose.

We expect to have about 100 lines of code altogether.
